=== Eclipse Build Platform Configuration

Now we need to configure Eclipse so that it knows about UOMo and where it lives so it can build against it.

NOTE: The default behavour of Eclipse when building plug-ins is to build against "itself"; that is to use the currently running plug-ins of the IDE as the build target.

. Click the menu “Window -> Preferences”
. Navigate to the “Plug-in Development -> Target Platform” section of the preferences dialog: +

Click “Add...”
. Select “Nothing: Start with an empty target definition” in the “New target definition” dialog: +

Click “Next”
. Give the new target a name, such as “UOMo”: +

Click “Add...”
. Select “Software Site” from the plug-in source options: +

Click “Next”
. You should now be in the "Add Content" dialog. From here we can add plugins to our target platform:. +

Firstly, we need to give our target definition a place to get Eclipse plug-ins from. Enter the URL http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno into the “Work With” field. Ensure that the “Group by Category” field is un-checked. +
Type “Eclipse Platform” into the search field: +
Select the Eclipse Platform (without +M*+ at the end :- as this is a milestone release) +
Click “Finish”
. Eclipse will do some loading/resolving... 
. Now we need to add the UOMo libraries to our target. Click “Add..” again on the target platform editor window. +
The select “Software Site” again. But this time enter the URL http://download.eclipse.org/uomo/0.6/repository/ +

Select the EclipseUOMo feature.

Select UOMo target and click “Apply”
. *(Optional)* You can click “Share..” if you want to save this target definition as a file for use in the future. Pick a location and a name for the target file in the window as below: +

Click “Finish” when you are done.
. Click “OK” on the preferences page and go back to the main Eclipse IDE.
