=== Unit Test Plug-in Code

. Now we are ready to test out our API with a Unit test. _What follows is a little long winded thanks to how Eclipse Plug-ins do unit tests._
. Firstly we need to create a New Fragment Project _(File -> New -> Project...)_: +

Click “Next”
. Give the fragment the name of our main project with “.test” appended: +

Click “Next”
. We need to give the fragment a “host” that is our +com.acme.n2l+ plugin: +
image:image01.png[] +
Click “Finish”
. Now we need to add JUnit to the fragment’s dependencies. Find and double click the +META-INF/MANIFEST.MF+ file to open the fragment manifest editor. Select the “Dependencies” tab: +

Click “Add...”
. Enter +junit+ in the search field: +

Select the org.junit plugin and click “OK”
. Now we create a unit test class in our fragment. Find and right click on our +NewtonsSeconLaw.java+ file and choose “New -> Other...” from the context menu.
. Select _Java -> JUnit -> JUnit_ Test Case from the dialog: +

Click “Next”
. Select the location for the unit test in the src folder of our test fragment. And select the calculateForce method for testing: +

Click “Finish”
. Now we need to replace the template test code with our own. Add the following:
+
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testCalculateForce() {
  MassAmount m = new MassAmount(1000, SI.KILOGRAM);
  AccelerationAmount a = new AccelerationAmount(2.5, SI.METRES_PER_SQUARE_SECOND);
  ForceAmount force = NewtonsSecondLaw.calculateForce(m, a);
  assertEquals(2500, force.doubleValue(SI.NEWTON), 0.0001);
}
----
+
This method simply creates a 1000 kg mass, a 2.5 m/s^2^ acceleration and asks our N2L class to calculate the force. We then assert that the calculated force is 2500 Newtons (+/- 0.0001).

. Save the file and Right click on it - then choose _Run As -> JUnit Plug-in Test_. The test will run and you should see the JUnit results window appear:

Now you have now completed and tested your first simple Unit-API project.So what...
