=== Introduction

JSR 385 is an API for working with physical quantities and units. We are going to create a demonstration application that provides an API to work with Newton’s Second Law of Motion:
_______
The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as, the net force acting on the body, and inversely proportional to its mass.
_______

Otherwise written as:

+F = M×A+

Where:

 * +F+ is Force in Newtons
 * +M+ is Mass in Kilograms
 * +A+ is Acceleration in Meters per second

Our example API will provide methods for computing any of the above, given the other two.

Example code for the following is available at GitHub:
